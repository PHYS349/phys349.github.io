## Course Description
This course introduces the physics and mathematics of quantum information processing. We will bridge the gap between abstract quantum mechanics and practical quantum algorithms.

**We will focus on:**
* **What quantum systems do differently:** Superposition, Entanglement, and Measurement (Why these are *not* just probability or parallelism).
* **Reasoning about what is and is not possible:** Where quantum advantage plausibly exists vs. where it provably does not (Speedups ≠ magic).
* **Key technologies:** NISQ computing, Quantum simulation (huge emphasis), Communication/QKD, and Sensing (LIGO, metrology).
* **Hands-on work:** Running simple circuits and executing a real algorithm on IBM hardware.

**We will avoid:**
* Heavy physics formalism (ODEs, Schrödinger equation).
* Deep algorithmic proofs.

## Learning Resources
### Textbooks (Optional)
The primary text for this course is the [Online Lecture Notes](https://phys349.github.io/). The following are optional references:
* **Rieffel & Polak**, *Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction* (Balance of concepts and formalism).
* **Hidary**, *Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach*, 2nd ed. (Emphasis on algorithms/hardware).
* **Bernhardt**, *Quantum Computing for Everyone* (Great concepts at high school math level).

### Python
No prior Python experience is required, but we will use it for homework. See the **Python Resources** page for setup guides.

## Assessment
Grades are posted on **Brightspace**. Homework is submitted via **Gradescope**.

| **Task** | **Weight** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Homework** | **35%** | Weekly problem sets (analytical & coding). Due Sundays at 11:59 PM. |
| **Midterm Exam** | **20%** | In-class exam covering fundamental concepts. |
| **Final Exam** | **25%** | Comprehensive final exam. |
| **Projects** | **10%** | End-of-semester exploration (e.g., hardware survey, algorithm demo). |
| **Participation** | **10%** | In-class work via iClicker. |

## Grading Scale
I reserve the right to lower these cutoffs (curve up) based on difficulty, but I will not raise them.

| Grade | Percentage Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A** | 85% – 100% |
| **B** | 75% – 84.9% |
| **C** | 65% – 74.9% |
| **D** | 50% – 64.9% |
| **F** | < 50% |

## Course Tools & Policies

### Piazza (Q&A)
We will use Piazza for class discussion. I encourage you to post questions here rather than emailing the staff.
* **Sign up:** [piazza.com/purdue/spring2026/wl202620phys34900001](https://piazza.com/purdue/spring2026/wl202620phys34900001)

### iClicker Cloud (Participation)
We will use iClicker Cloud for active learning polls. You can use a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
1.  **Grading:** 50% for participation, 50% for accuracy.



### AI & Large Language Models
**Philosophy: The "Co-Pilot" Model**
I encourage you to use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) to support your learning.

* **✅ Approved:** Concept explanation, debugging code, active tutoring.
* **❌ Prohibited:** Blind copy-pasting of assignment prompts.
* **Warning:** LLMs are frequently confident but wrong on technical quantum problems.

> **The "Knowledge Gap" Warning:** Homework builds intuition; exams test it. If you rely entirely on AI for homework, you will likely struggle on the exams where these tools are not available.
