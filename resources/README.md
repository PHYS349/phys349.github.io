To generate a PDF version of the public syllabus, convert to HTML in VSCode and print to PDF in a browser.

I use ctrl shift v  in vscode with MyST-Markdown extension to view before uploading to github.  It opens a html preview of the page.  You can place it to the side for a live preview in VSCode.  Do no use other markdown extensions because Jupyter Book 2 uses MyST Markdown, which is quite different than standard GitHub Markdown for equations and figures and referencesa.
