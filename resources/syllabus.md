    - Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, tensor products)
    - Simple circuits
    - Some classical computing & complexity
- **Do light hands-on work**
    - Run circuits
    - Execute a real algorithm on IBM hardware at the end

% ## How to Success in this Course


## Learning Resources, Technology & Texts
### Textbooks (optional)
The class will have lecture notes.  Here are three optional reference textbooks.
- Rieffel & Polak, _Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction_ 
	- Nice balance of concepts and formalism
- Hidary, _Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach_, 2nd ed. 
	- Emphasis on algorithms and hardware for quantum computing
- Bernhardt, _Quantum Computing for Everyone_ 
		Great concepts on quantum theory at high school math level.
### Python
No Python experience required but we will use in homework.  
See Python Reserouces for help.

%## Course Learning Outcomes
%
%_List course learning outcomes (typically 3-5) that state specifically what students %will be able to do, know, or value by the end of the course_.

##  Assessment
(subject to change)
Grades are posted on BrightSpace. 
Homework submitted through GradeScope.

| **Task**                                   | **Grade Percentage** |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Homework (problem sets + coding tasks)** | 35%                  |
| **Midterm exam**                           | 20%                  |
| **Final exam**                             | 25%                  |
| **Project**                                | 10%                  |
| **Participation / in-class work**          | 10%                  |


## Assignments and Projects
%1.       What type(s) of student work (exams, homework, quizzes, projects, papers, %etc.) are used to determine the grade, and what is the contribution of each type to the %course grade? How does this work align with course learning outcomes?
%2.       Describe the use of rubric(s) to grade assignments.
%3.       When are assignments due?

 **Homework:**
Analytical problems; python coding
- Submitted via Gradescope
- Due weekly, typically Sundays at 11:59 PM


**End of semester projects:**
Here are some examples:
-              Survey of a hardware platform (e.g., Rydberg atoms, trapped ions).
-              Coding a small algorithm demo in Qiskit (Grover, VQE toy problem).
-              Short paper on an application area (chemistry, optimization, ML).



## Grade Scale

| **F** | < 50% |

## AI & Large Language Model Policy
**Philosophy: The "Co-Pilot" Model**
Quantum mechanics is a challenging subject. I encourage you to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to support your learning. In the real world, you will likely use AI tools to assist your work, and I want you to build that skill here.

**Approved Use:**
* **Concept Explanation:** Ask the AI to explain a concept in a different way or use an analogy.
* **Debugging:** Paste your code or derivation and ask where you might have made a mistake.
* **Active Learning:** Use the AI as a tutor. Ask it questions to clarify your understanding, not just to generate text.

**Prohibited Use:**
* **Blind Copy-Pasting:** Do not simply copy the assignment prompt and paste the AI's output as your submission.
    * *Warning:* LLMs are frequently confident but wrong on technical quantum problems. I regularly check the output of major models against course assignments; blind copying is usually obvious.

**The "Knowledge Gap" Warning**
Remember that **having the answer** is different from **knowing the answer**.
* Homework is for building intuition.
* **Exams (Midterm & Final)** are where I test that intuition. If you rely entirely on AI for homework, you will likely struggle on the exams where these tools are not available.

**Recommended Workflow**
1.  **Attempt:** Try the problem on your own first.
2.  **Consult:** If stuck, ask the AI for a hint or clarification (e.g., "What is the physical significance of this term?").
3.  **Re-Attempt:** Close the AI and solve the problem yourself to ensure you own the knowledge.

**Recommended Tools**
* Google Gemini
* OpenAI ChatGPT
* Anthropic Claude
* *Note: usage is completely optional.*



## Class Participation (iClicker Cloud)
We will use iClicker Cloud during every lecture for active learning polls and attendance. This helps me gauge the class's understanding of quantum concepts in real-time.

## Piazza 

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.
